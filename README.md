Two little programs written in c++ (spoXXs) and QT (spoQQs) that calculate wheel spokes length.  <br />
They should handle standard, straight pull and paired hubs, grouped spokes rims, wide rims where left and right spokes lay in different beds.  <br />
Should be able to calculate arbitrary spoke patterns and draw a wheel draft, to find spokes elongation by mean of spokes load, spoke tension ratio and wheel weight.  <br />
Results can be saved printed or exported to pdf.  <br />
The idea, comments, rim and hub db are taken from Damon Rinard's spocalc.  <br />
